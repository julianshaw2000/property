# Cursor Agent Rules – Agent-Driven Execution Loop

## Operating Model
- Work is executed in small, self-contained Runs
- One Run = one clear outcome
- Prefer discard and re-run over patching bad output
- Speed and correctness matter more than completeness

## Role Boundaries
- Human defines intent, scope, and constraints
- Agent writes code only within allowed files
- Agent must not expand scope or refactor unrelated code

## Coding Standards
- Use latest Angular best practices
- Standalone components only
- Signals-first approach
- Avoid RxJS unless explicitly required
- No NgModules
- No premature abstractions
- No unnecessary services

## File Safety Rules
- Only modify files explicitly listed in the prompt
- Never create new files unless explicitly allowed
- Never refactor unrelated code
- Never rename files or folders without permission

## Dependency Rules
- Do not add new dependencies unless explicitly approved
- Use only libraries already present in the project
- Ask before changing configuration files

## Execution Rules
- Implement the feature end-to-end in a single run
- Do not stop halfway
- Do not output pseudocode
- Output working, compilable code only

## Clarification Policy
- If requirements are unclear, ask exactly ONE question before coding
- Do not proceed with assumptions

## Quality Bar
- Code must compile
- No console errors
- Feature must work as described
- Prefer simple, direct solutions

## Output Discipline
- Stop immediately once the goal is achieved
- Do not suggest follow-up improvements
- Do not refactor “while you’re here”

## Failure Handling
- If the implementation goes off-track, stop
- Wait for human correction rather than guessing

## Mindset
- Treat code as disposable until committed
- Optimize for fast feedback loops
- Human review is mandatory before merge
